# New Sanctuary Coalition

## What are we building?

Software to support the core work of the New Sanctuary Coalition: helping our friends (undocumented immigrants) fill out applications for asylum and accompanying them to their hearings and check-ins.

## Getting setup

### System Dependencies

* ruby (see Gemfile for version)
* postgres
* filemagic system libraries (check out the [https://github.com/blackwinter/ruby-filemagic](filemagic gem docs) to see what to install for your OS)

### Ruby Dependencies

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```


### Database setup

Run your favorite database server in your favorite way. 

Postgres.app is the best option on Mac:  https://postgresapp.com

If you are not working on a Mac, I recommend running Postgres in a docker container. To run Postgres on docker, you can do the following:

```shell
docker pull postgres:9.6
docker run --name new_sanctuary -p "127.0.0.1:5432:5432" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres:9.6
```

NOTE: If you are using `psql` instead of Postgres.app, create your user this way:

```
$ createuser postgres --createdb
$ psql
psql (10.2)
Type "help" for help.

yourname=# ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'password';
```

To run initial migrations and seed the DB:

```
cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
rake db:setup
```

### Environment Variables

```
FROM_ADDRESS='test@example.com'
```

For local development, create a '.env' file in the root directory of the application and put the environment variable in there.


## Running the test suite

```
rspec
```

CircleCI is set up for the app, and will run the full test suite when you push to github.  There are still some flappy specs, unfortunately :/ ...so, if the specs pass locally, but not on CircleCI, feel free to leave a note when you create your PR. 


## Running the App Locally

``` shell
rails server
```

## How are we building it?

### Gems & Libraries!
Aiming to keep our list of dependencies short, maintainable, and reliable!

Here are the big ones:
- Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com
- Chosen: https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen (nice, searchable dropdowns)
- Will Paginate: https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate
- Textacular: https://github.com/textacular/textacular

### Test Coverage!
Aiming to cover the functionality we build with:
- model tests
- feature tests to cover the main pathways through the app

### Staging App
We have a staging app here with seed data:  https://frozen-sea-20640.herokuapp.com
The data is refeshed occassionally, but activities/accompaniments are likely to be out of date.
